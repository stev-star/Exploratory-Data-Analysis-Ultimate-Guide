Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing data sets in order to understand it in depth and summarize 

their main characteristics, often with the aid of visual methods.

The main aim of EDA is to spot patterns and trends, to identify anomalies, and to test early hypotheses.

before you perform data analysis and run your data through an any algorithm. You need to know the patterns 

in your data and determine which variables are important and which do not play a significant role in the output. 


## Steps involved in Exploratory data analysis.

The steps involved in exploratory data analysis (EDA) can vary depending on the data set and the goals of the analysis,

but some general steps that are typically followed include:


### Data collection: 

Gathering the data from various sources, which may include internal databases, external datasets, or manual data entry.

#### Dataset Used

We will use the employee data for this. It contains 23 columns namely â€“ First Name, Gender, Start Date, 

Last Login, Salary, Bonus%, Senior Management, and Team.



#### Data cleaning: 

Identifying and correcting errors, missing data, and inconsistencies in the data set. 

This may involve removing or imputing missing data, correcting data entry errors, or dealing with outliers.

### Data visualization:

Creating visualizations of the data to explore patterns, relationships, and trends. 

This can include scatter plots, histograms, box plots, heat maps, and other types of visualizations.
